# Simulating-Chi-squared-dist

## Code
So far, this code can simulate chi-square distribution by simulating sample variance distribution.
- sample: randomly selected from a population obeying chi-square distribution
- sample variance: the variance of a sample

## Chi-square distribution
- Chi-square distribution is determined by degree of freedom
- Sample variance distribution is influenced by degree of freedom and sample size

# NEXT TO DO
- actual data test

## Chi-Sqaure test
Application
- test whether two non-numerical (categorical) random variables influence each other
- Using alpha level to determine whether reject the null assumption or not

Example
- color of eyes & gender
- null assumption (default assumption): there is no relationship between a person's eye color and the gender 



## To be improved
- test actual data
