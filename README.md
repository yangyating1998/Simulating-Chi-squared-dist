# Simulating-Chi-squared-dist

## Code
This code is used to simulating Chi-square distribution

NO actual data is been testified; this is the IDEAL chi-sqaure distribution

## Chi-Sqaure test
Application: test whether two non-numerical (categorical) random variables influence each other

Example: color of eyes & gender

## Math Terms, Assumptions, and Results

### Math Terms
df degree of freedom, df changes the distribution

### Assumptions
Null assumption: Chi-square assumes no relationship between two variables

### Results
Using alpha level to determine whether reject the null assumption or not
